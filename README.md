# ISFOG 2020 Pile driving prediction event

This repository contains the data for the ISFOG2020 pile driving prediction event as well as a demonstration of how a machine learning model can be selected, trained and validated.

## Installation

People who are new to data science are encouraged to first install the necessary tools on their machine. [An installation guide](./notebooks/ISFOG%202020%20-%20Pile%20driving%20prediction%20event%20-%20Installation.ipynb) is provided to guide users through the installation process.

## Machine learning demo

[A calculation notebook](./notebooks/Prediction%20event%20demo.ipynb) shows the necessary calculations for exploring the data and training a machine learning model. Model quality metrics and model validation are also covered. Based on this example, you can develop the model further or propose alternative prediction models. 

## Feedback and discussion

If you run into any problems while installing the software or if you have questions about the data or prediction exercise, you can use the issues section of this repository.
